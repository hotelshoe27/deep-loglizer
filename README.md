# loglizer

Loglizer is a machine learning-based log analysis toolkit for system anomaly detection. Logs are imperative in the development and maintenance process of many software systems. They record detailed
runtime information during system operation that allows developers and support engineers to monitor their systems and dissect anomalous behaviors and errors. Loglizer provides such a tool that implements a set of automated log analysis techniques for anomaly detection.

## Framework

![Framework of Anomaly Detection](/docs/img/FrameWork.png)

The log analysis framework for anomaly detection usually comprises the following components:

1. **Log collection:** Logs are generated at runtime and aggregated into a centralized place with a data streaming pipeline, such as Flume and Kafka. 
2. **Log parsing:** Logs are naturally unstructured. The goal of log parsing is to convert unstructured log messages into a sequence of structured events, based on which sophisticated machine learning models can be applied. The details of log parsing can be found at [our logparser project](https://github.com/logpai/logparser).
3. **Feature extraction:** Structured logs can be sliced into separate log sequences through interval window, sliding window, or session window. Then, each log sequence is vectorized into feature representation, for example, using an event counting vector. 
4. **Anomaly detection:** Anomaly detection models are trained to check whether a given feature vector is an anomaly or not.
